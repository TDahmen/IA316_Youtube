IA316 Youtube Project (2020)

Five .py files define the essential classes : agents.py for the agents, and env.py, channels.py, videos.py and users.py
for the environment.

Three notebooks allowed us to obtain results for the presentation : evolution.ipynb demonstrates the influence of the
gamma parameter of the evolution process; curves.ipynb illustrates the probability model on the watch time of a video
by a given user (dependance of the variance to the mean, and resulting Beta densities for different means);
experiments.ipynb is where experiments in both the non-evolutive and evolutive cases were run for the three agents.

Finally, the presentation is available as the IA316_Youtube.pdf file.
